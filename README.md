## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

I learnt React. This is the first time I've done anything in React and there are alot of things I would like to highlight but I will just talk of the awesomeness of `state` and `conditonal rendering`, this is are game changers, like having a fully interactive app with so little code increase productivity exponentially.
```jsx
  const [person, setPerson] = useState(1);
```
```jsx
  {person == 0 && <p className='bg-red-600'>Can't be zero</p>}
```
In the second snippet, if the value of `person` is zero, this `p` tag is visible on the page just like that!!

### Continued development

I'm going to work hard and improve my skills, once I'm done with React Docs, I'll move on to NextJS and continue soaring...

### Useful resources

- [React Docs](https://react.dev/) - This helped me a lot, from writing vanilla JS to React was not by any means easy. I'm super excited to see where how this goes. My code feels more organized and like there's a lot of possibilities which each challenge that pops up, it's amazing.
